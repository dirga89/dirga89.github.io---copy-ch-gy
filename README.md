## Welcome to Mr. Marchant's Example Page!

This page is designed to show a simple, straightforward example of what can be put together on GitHub pages with minimal work. There isn't anything exciting in the GitHub repository linked above, just access to the Markdown code used to make this site if you want to see it. Everything else I made is at [my main website](https://mrmarchant.com/).

### Using Markdown

See the code block below for examples on how to add headers, lists, links, and more to your site:

```markdown

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### A Note on Adding Images

![cactus](cactus.jpg "Taken at the Fullerton Arboritum on a Pixel 2!")

To add an image to your site with markdown, you have two options. You can use an image you upload into your repository or provide a link to an image hosted elsewhere. There is already a fantastic guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1) if you want more details.

To add an image from your repository, you need to first upload the image to your site's GitHub repository. Then you put the full name of the file as the "src" in the image syntax.

You can also put a link to an image already hosted elsewhere (typically found by right clicking and selecting "copy image address") into the "src" to get it to load that way.
